			        <p><b>Storj</b> (pronounced: storage) aims to become a cloud storage platform that can’t be censored or monitored, or have downtime. Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows users to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, it will be cheaper, faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.</p>

					<p>Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, <a href="https://metadisk.org/" class="link">MetaDisk</a>, and client app, <a href="https://driveshare.org/" class="link">DriveShare</a>. It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.</p>

					<p>To best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on users’ computers before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of DriveShare nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for <b>Storjcoin X (SJCX)</b>.</p>

					<p>The decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and with client-side encryption, the users are in control of their keys.</p>

			        <p>Storj is a cloud storage platform. The key word in that sentence is ‘platform’ because without it, Storj would just really be a decentralized cloud storage alternative. While a decentralized cloud storage alternative in itself would still be a great product, what we are creating goes beyond that.</p>

					<p>Storj allows users to create decentralized applications. We have already begun to see basic demos using the MetaDisk API and pulling content from the network, including an image viewer, a .txt and .pdf viewer, a music player, and even a video service. Some of these services have even been thrown into a Storj Media Center of sorts.</p>

					<p>Our corporate entity Storj Labs aims to bring decentralized cloud storage to the average business and consumer. With constant data breaches and high costs, users are becoming more aware that the current model of cloud storage is broken. Storj Labs provides DaaS (Data-as-a-Service), as well as help building tools and APIs for customers to be able to interface with this new cloud storage model.</p>

			        <p>Drive Farming is the term used to describe the act of selling or renting out extra hard drive space. This is most comparable to traditional crypto-currency mining. Users allocate a portion of their available hard drive space and specify a folder on their drive to store network data.</p>
			        <p>This space stores small encrypted shards of MetaDisk users’ files. This means that no farmer holds the entire file that a user uploaded, and because the file is encrypted, it's unlikely that the farmer could read it anyway.</p>
			        <p>If someone attempts to access and alter the files that they are storing, the shard will fail the next challenge issued by the owner of the data. This will result in the malicious node being dropped, and the network will select another location to store the shard. And of course, the network doesn’t pay cheating nodes.</p>

					</ul>
					<p class="small">*Details are subject to change.</p>
					<p>SJCX can be purchased at any time and be added to your address balance to be able to qualify for Test Group C. Also your original crowdsale address can be topped up to and over 10,000 SJCX to be eligible for Test Group A.</p>
					<p>“Not Rewarded” means Group A will only be helping with testing and will not earn coins for sharing their storage. “Rewarded” means you will earn SJCX to share your unused storage during beta testing (Groups B and C).</p>
					<p>Make sure you use an SJCX or Bitcoin address where you control the private keys, we do not recommend using an address from an exchange. We will need to verify you actually own the address before you are allowed to be a tester.</p>

			        <p><strong>CONFIG:</strong>  The config command is currently only run once when you first run dataserv-client (ie, starting from 0 without previous build).  Currently only one argument, --set_payout_address is necessary.  Config will create your config.json file which will include your payout address, your private key/wallet address and the version of the client under which is was created.</p>

					<p><strong>FARM:</strong> The farm command is a compilation of multiple commands and currently serves as the primary command in the dataserv-client application.  Farm includes the functions register, build and poll, run in that order.</p>

					<p>dataserv-client --store_path <your path> --max_size <your max size> farm</p>

					<p><strong>REGISTER:</strong> The register command is no longer used in dataserv-client except as a component of the farm command.  Register communicates with the server your payout address and authentication address, linking the two together and setting the date that your build started.  This is the point where you payout address is linked to your auth address and you wallet address.  Your payout address and wallet are the seeds for you auth address (ie a single config.json will always create the same auth address)</p>

					<p><strong>BUILD:</strong> The build command is a testing command and will likely play no role once peer-to-peer data transfers begin.  In the tests, build is the engine that creates shards (SHA 256 hashes).  Build includes periodic pinging of the server with your current height.  By default, build pings the server every 25 shards with your current height.  Once the build is finished (reaches --max_size) build will report your final height to the server.</p>

					<p><strong>POLL:</strong> The poll command is a simple ping of the server to tell it that your build is live and being shared on the network.  Poll does not tell the server your height but reports that you are live.  The height that is reported is the last height reported by build.  Poll can be run independently when desired to stay live on the status page during farm command with high –set_height_interval</p>

Rewards will be advertised but the breakdown and rules governing are subject to change as the project evolves.  Rewards are present to provide motivation/incentive for participation in the tests.  Rewards are NOT payment for testing.  Rewards are NOT equivalent to mining rewards.</p>

                    <p>At the present time each payout address must have a minimum of 10,000 SJCX to qualify for rewards and upon request any address that was not affiliated with the crowdsale, will have to have 10,000 SJCX donated to the rewards pool to qualify for future rewards.  There is NO guarantee of rewards equaling or exceeding the 10,000 SJCX donation.</p>

                    <p>Rewards are calculated using a fair methodology that looks at available data at the time of snapshots such as capacity and SJCX holdings and via server tracking of data such as duration of registered address, uptime and audit success.

			        <p>At this stage in testing and until peer-to-peer data transfers are tested, dataserv-client locally generates empty containers, inflated to 128MB (friendly size) each. These empty containers are “shards”.  The build portion of the farm command will create a predetermined number of  shards based on your --max_size setting.  Shards are encrypted using SHA 256 hashes.  Each shared hash is created determinalistically based on the seed.  At the present time that seed is your payout address.  In the future, there may be an option to create shards using your auth address as the seed (please stay tuned for that option and how to utilize it). </p>

					<p>What deterministic shard/hash creation means is that any build using a specific payout address will create the same shards in the same order.  While not tested, multiple builds to the same payout address may pose issues with the audit function.  It is therefore advised that multiple builds be created to different payout addresses.</p>

					<p>Your height, as reported at <a href="https://status.driveshare.org/api/online/json" class="link">https://status.driveshare.org/api/online/json</a> is based on the number of shards that you are reporting live to the server (read build and poll definitions).  Only the shards that have been reported to the server by the build function and then reported as live by the poll function will appear in your height.</p>

					<p>The storage capacity reported on <a href="https://driveshare.org/status.html" class="link">https://driveshare.org/status.html</a> is a derivative of your height. The current calculation uses the friendly 8000 shards per TB (800 shards per 100GB, 8 shards per GB).</p>

			        <p>The friendly method of determining drive size or file size is by multiplying by 1000 (ie 1KB = 1000 bytes).  In actuality, the real multiplier is 1024 (ie 1KB = 1024 bytes).  The same ratio is always present.  1TB =1024 GB, 1GB =1024MB, 1MB = 1024KB.  The confusion that often happens is when both friendly and actual sizes are referenced together, or when a friendly size is referenced and the means of checking said size use actual bytes.</p>

					<p>For the purposes of Storj and the DriveShare test groups, both have been used.  128MB, the size of a shard, is referenced with a friendly file size (actual size is 134,2117,728 bytes = 128*1024*1024).  The current display on the status page also uses the friendly method to display capacity.  Formerly, the status page did display actual capacity.  As mentioned above the number of shards divided by 8000 will give your friendly size, however, number of shards divided by 8192 will give you your actual size.</p>

					<p>Further complicating this file size/drive capacity issue is the fact that many OSs and external drive devices will hold a certain amount of drive space in reserve (buffers, error protection, etc).  This space isn’t visible to the user and should not be utilized (it is there for drive health).</p>

			        <p>Rewards are an incentive provided by the developers of the Storj project to encourage participation in the testing process and should NOT be considered a form of payment or a form of return on investment.  Rewards are NOT guaranteed.  The structure of, timing of and amount of rewards are subject to change during the testing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 1:</strong></p>
                    <p>To qualify for rewards the first step is to possess 10,000 SJCX in your payout address.  Compliance with this requirement will be tracked through <a href="http://blockscan.com" class="link">http://blockscan.com</a> and in order to ensure that you are compliant it is advised that any transactions be made 24 hours prior to any deadlines, snapshot or donations request to ensure that the transaction will appear on the blockchain.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 2a: Crowdsale Participants</strong></p>
                    <p>For those that participated in the Crowdsale, simply holding 10,000 SJCX in your payout address will qualify you for full rewards.  Holding &gt;0 but &lt;10,000 SJCX will qualify a Crowdsale participant for partial rewards.  The fraction of full rewards will be determined by the developers, but will be a maximum of the percentage of 10,000 SJCX held.</p>

                    <p><strong>Qualifying for Rewards – Step 2b: Non-Crowdsale Participants</strong></p>
                    <p>For non-crowdsale participants there will be a request for donations prior to TGB M3-2 (test group b, milestone 3, part 2).  Prior to this request, qualification for rewards is the same as for crowdsale participants.  Once the request is made, qualification for rewards is dependent on a donation of 10,000 SJCX to the rewards pool.  There will be a window to donate prior to the commencement of TGB M3-2 testing & tracking.  There is NO partial rewards for non-crowdsale members.  A donation entitles a non-crowdsale participant to full rewards based on their stats.</p>

                    <p>A non-crowdsale participant does not need to both donate and hold 10K SJCX during TGB M3-2 to qualify for rewards.  Only the donation is required for rewards qualification.</p>

                    <p>There is NO guarantee that any participant, crowdsale or otherwise, will receive 10,000 SJCX (or any amount for that matter) in rewards during TGB M3-2</p>

                    <p>Policies have not been announced at the present time as to requirements for holding or donations for future test groups.  Once announced, this information will be updated.  Any statements about these policies are unofficial or speculative until announced officially.</p>

					<p>While not always the case, many of these 401 Unauthorized errors are associated with your local clock being out of sync with the server clock.

In typical situations, pings should take only milliseconds, but if clocks are not synced, this time can appear much larger.</p>
					<p>To resolve this issue, you should take measures to sync your clock with internet time (methods vary and you should research your specific operating system to ensure that your clock is synced).  It is possible, over time, for a synced clock to fall out of sync with internet time, so either this process will need to be repeated or periodic syncing done via software.</p>

			        <p>During testing, the simple answer is no.  Since we aren’t dealing with any real data and network traffic is minimal (outbound pings only), adding redundancy such as RAID 1 or 5, will only reduce your capacity and not provide any real benefits to you.  All files are locally generated during testing (to-date) and once your build is complete, drive activity will be drastically reduced.</p>
					<p>Once testing progresses to a point where there is actual data being shared, the question become a bit murky, but redundancy still may not be worth the loss of capacity.  Depending on the structure and network activity expected during later testing phases, you might want to start considering local redundancy.</p>
					<p>Once Storj does go live, there will be redundancy at a network level, with multiple farmers holding each shard.  That redundancy protects the user’s data but doesn’t protect the farmer from drive failures or data corruption.  At that point, local redundancy may be appealing but is a decision that must be weighed against storage capacity loss, likelihood of drive failure, drive activity, and many other variables.  For those with large amount of storage and high demand clients, it might be beneficial to have local redundancy to protect your investment.</p>

			        <p>The easy answer here is yes, it is possible to farm/build to multiple paths using a single payout address?  The caveat to that statement is that at the present time, only the largest of those builds counts toward your rewards (this may change in the near future).</p>
					<p>In order to build to multiple paths, you will need to create two separate builds.  There are two basic methods for doing this.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Farm/build from two separate computers to two unique file paths</p></li>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Run datasev-client normally from both computers, starting with:</p></li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>‘dataserv-client config --set_payout_address &lt;your counterwallet address&gt;’ (first time only) then;</p></li>
								<li><p>‘dataserv-client --store_path &lt;your path&gt; --max_size &lt;your size&gt; farm’</p></li>
							</ol>
						</ul>
						<li><p>Farm/build from the same computer to two unique file paths (not on the same drive)</p></li>
						<ul>
							<li><p><strong>NOTE: This is the same method you would use if you wanted multiple builds from the same computer but pointing to different payout addresses.</strong></p></li>
							<li><p>Run dataserv-client with --config_path &lt;your complete path including file name&gt; as the first argument in ALL command lines</p></li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>In Windows:  C:\users\&lt;username&gt;\.storj\</p></li>
								<li><p>In Linux: $HOME/.storj (e.g. /home/&lt;username&gt;/.storj)</p></li>
								<li><p>In Mac: home/.storj/config.json (e.g. &lt;username&gt;/.storj/ (.storj may be a hidden folder)</p></li>
							</ol>
							<li><p>You path should end with something like configX.json, where “X” is a unique identifier for each build. You can use the same folder path for all .json files, but to avoid overwriting, the “X” must be different.</p></li>
							<li><p>Run through each config and farm command separately and run them simultaneously</p></li>
							<ol>
								<li><p>FIRST PATH X: ‘dataserv-client --config_path &lt;your full path/configX.json&gt; config --set_payout_address &lt;your counterwallet address&gt;’ (first time only) then;</p></li>
								<li><p>FIRST PATH X: ‘dataserv-client --config_path &lt;your full path/configX.json&gt; --store_path &lt;your path X&gt; --max_size &lt;your size&gt; farm’</p></li>
								<li><p>SECOND PATH Y: ‘dataserv-client --config_path &lt;your full path/configY.json&gt; config --set_payout_address &lt;your counterwallet address&gt;’ (first time only) then;</p></li>
								<li><p>SECOND PATH Y: ‘dataserv-client --config_path &lt;your full path/configY.json&gt; --store_path &lt;your path Y&gt; --max_size &lt;your size&gt; farm’</p></li>
							</ol>
							<li><p>The use of a batch file our other automated method can be beneficial to avoid leaving something out or accidentally running the wrong configuration to the wrong folder.</p></li>
						</ul>
					</ol>
					<p>Either method you use, each build will have the same payout address, but unique auth and wallet addresses.  Each build will show up separately on the stats page.  Each build will have exactly the same files in the same order per the deterministic build method used in the client (payout address is the seed).</p>
					<p>There is currently no support for a single farm/build command to multiple paths.  To utilize multiple physical drives on a single build, you will want to use JBOD (spanning), RAID or other multi-drive implementations in your OS prior to starting dataserv-client.</p>

			        <p>Deleting all of your shards and starting from scratch is a last resort measure.  Unless it is absolutely needed, you shouldn’t do it.  It takes time and you would just be recreating the exact same files that you already created once.</p>
					<p>There are some instances when rebuilding from 0 is absolutely necessary, some obvious but some are specific to the way farm works.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p><strong>MOST IMPORTANT REASON:</strong> If you change your payout address for ANY reason (want to use different counterwallet, didn’t use your payout address to start with, forgot to set payout address, etc), you will need to farm/build from zero shards.  Your payout address is currently the seed for all hash creation and if you switch this number, the shards you have won’t match the seed and will be ignored, wasting drive space.</p></li>
						<li><p>If you drive fails and you no longer have access to all the shards that you created, you may need to start over on a new drive.  A shard repair function is scheduled to be in the next release and this may assist with missing shards, allowing you to continue without rebuilding.</p></li>
					</ol>
					<p>There are more often situations that DON’T require a complete rebuild.  The following are issues and scenarios that do not (typically) require a complete rebuild.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Your farm/build crashes in mid-process</p></li>
						<li><p>You change your store_path (you can just copy the files in the old location to the new one before you restart farm)</p></li>
						<li><p>You get errors. (the vast majority of errors will not require a rebuild)</li>
						<li><p>You change your max_size.</p></li>
						<li><p>You aren’t showing up on the status page.</p></li>
						<li><p>You upgrade your client to the newest release (recommended). EXCEPTION:  If there is a request/recommendation that you rebuild from zero.</p></li>
						<li><p>You have shards that aren’t 128MB.  The next release of the client will have a repair function built into farm.</p></li>

					<p>Calculating the hash of a file in no way lets you determine the content of the file. If a farmer only has a small chunk of an encrypted file, then even if he had the keys he would still need to know about and collect all the other chunks before being able to read the content of the file.</p>
					<p>So users can store anything they want in private, and potentially distribute it to people they trust, but as soon as a shard's content is made public, it can be greylisted.</p>

Some people have to realize that there needs to be a shift in belief on all sides for us to make widespread use of decentralized tools a reality. There are institutions and organizations that have only ever known and felt comfortable with top-down, centralized methods of enforcement or management. What we're offering is a completely decentralized way for folks to be empowered and follow their own ethics and beliefs. If you disempower people entirely, they may become afraid and try to lash out with centralized hammers (e.g. outright bans, etc.). </p>

They usually don't care as much about decentralization, so their "solutions" are usually broad and heavy. It also creates an "us vs. them" mentality.

Each payment would be $0.000000042. One satoshi, as of time of writing, is worth $0.0000037. This means Bitcoin would place some economic restrictions on the network.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Micropayment Lockup</b> - We plan on using micropayment channels, which require locking up coins on the blockchain for the duration of the channel.

Currency volatility can directly impact the profitability of nodes, and cause problems for the network.

			        <p>We are using the <a href="http://counterparty.io/" class="link">Counterparty</a> protocol which means coins are created not mined. We created 500M SJCX, then locked the token. No more SJCX can or will be created. Around 10% of these have been released to the public via crowdsale and other methods.</p>
                    <p>The funds are currently held in a multisig address controlled by Storj Labs Inc. We have followed, and will continue to follow, the guidelines of usage set by the <a href="https://storj.io/CrowdsaleTerms.pdf" class="link">crowdsale terms</a>.</p>

			        <p>While we lack the technical capability to prevent the sale of SJCX wallets/addresses, we do not condone this. Selling a wallet means sharing your private keys with another individual. Sharing your keys permanently damages the privacy of that wallet as there is no way to revoke the original owner's access. The original owner will still be able to move funds from the wallet at any time in the future.</p>
					<p>In addition, we will not change the posted SJCX address whitelist for any reason unless an original crowdsale participant--eligible for testing rounds A/B--was mistakenly left off.</p>

			        <p>This is not a guarantee for employment, but we found that people who were excited about building the open-source tool-set perform exponentially better than the people we hired directly.
